<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZLqitKdqp400ODLuUq-Cyhvvl7b0Ov6mcsGTfbNr6E/edit" target=_blank>My CV</a>
<p>I am currently a Masters student at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) studying Mathematical Computer Science. I have an interest in both theoretical computer science and computational mathematics. I have also attended UIC as an undergraduate student in the past, and during that time had experience as a learning assistant for the university's mathematics courses where I assisted students with coursework and conceptual understanding of mathematics both inside and outside the classroom. This experience has made me appreciate instruction of mathematics and hopes to pursue teaching mathematics in the future. My objective is to be able to translate my programming and mathematical skills into a career, preferably in the fields of data science, mathematical teaching, or the video game industry.</p>
